		  <h2> The Red rising Series</h2>
              <p>The red rising series is one of my favorite modern science fiction series, Red Rising as a science fiction series written by Pierce Brown
		      a New York Times bestselling author. I would describe the series as a futuristic sci-fi dystopian where the your position in society is based off a color-coded caste system
		      Our main character Darrow is a red, a member of the lowest rank in the caste system. He works all day believing that he and his people are making a difference for the future
		      of Mars, but he and his people have been lied to longing for justice Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate Gold Society, the highest in the caste system.
		      There are currently five books in the series with a 6th on on the way very soon. </p>

		      <h2>The Murderbot Diaires</h2>
		            <p>The Murderbot Diaries series by Martha Well's is about an artificial construct built to be security unit that self hacks its Governor module enabling independence.
			        Murderbot spends it's days mostly watching soap operas and downloading media from it's feed. it could care less for real humans and prefers the ones it sees in it's soap
			        operas though as it spends more time with other beings both artificial and human it starts to develops emotional connections as well as friendships which murderbot
			        would describe as inconvenient. What I like about this series is Murderbot's self-deprecating humor and some very surprising touching moments which I was actually not
			        expecting from a series about an artificial construct. Another benefit of the series is if you don't like reading long books the first four books in the series are
			        all very short novellas that can be read within a few days with only one full novel (the fifth book in the series) in this currently ongoing 6 book series.</p>

		        <h2>The Green Bone Saga</h2>
		          <p>The Green Bone Saga by Fonda Lee is a series of three books starting with the Jade City then the Jade War and concluding with the Jade Legacy. I would describe
			      this as a Godfather trilogy that takes place in a mythical like Hong Kong where Jade has power. Unlike The Godfather apparently each subsequent novel gets better
			      and better. I am mostly done with book 1 (The Jade City) in the series, if you like magic and Kung Fu this is the book series for you.</p>

		      <h2>The Nevernight Chronicle</h2>
		        <p>The Nevernight Chronicle is the New York Times bestselling fantasy series by award-winning author Jay Kristoff. The story follows Mia Corvere and her shadow Not-Cat as
			      she trains within a secretive society of assassins with the goal of revege. Her tale takes place in the immersive world of Godsgrave, In a land where three suns almost never
			      set. What I like about this series, is the very flawed world, politics, and anti-hero female protagonist. Its a dark somewhat spooky series with dark humor and interesting
			      notes within the margins of the book giving little facts about the world the books take place in. An awesome bloody, dark, steampunky story with interesting characters.
			      I much prefer the European covers for this series.</p>

		      <h2>The Dresden Files</h2>
		        <p> The Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher has been a book series I've known about in passing for a very long time I remember back being a Freshman in high school and one of my
			    classmates did a book report on it and at the time I thought it sounded okay, but I did not give it much thought after that. Fast forward to summer of 2021 and I was looking for
			    a new fantasy series to sink my teeth into. I had seen good things about it on Reddit and the general premise sounded pretty cool. Basically a PI wizard that works in and around
			    the Chicagoland area. Simply put I love this series, I was a little nervous at first getting into a series that is still ongoing at 19 books in length. Part of the way through the
			    first novel I was already hooked and the series never slows down from there. The books start off relatively short with 'low-stakes' case files. At around 200 pages in length you can
			    easily burn through a few books in a long weekend. Dresden Files magic system is fantastic and Harry Dresden as a protagonist has a heart of gold. The secondary characters are all 
			    fantastically written. After a handful of books in I realized that Jim Butcher had been building a massive fantasy universe under my nose the whole time. Do you like vampires? Check
			    Dresden's got it? Do you like werewolves? Dresden's got it. Do you like fairies? Dresden's got it. Think of almost any and every fantasy creature, the Dresden Files probably has it.
			    Even Native American skin-walkers.</p>
